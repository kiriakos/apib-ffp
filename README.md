# API Blueprint For Fun and Profit (APIB-FFP)

What we want to achieve in this workshop:

1. Get a feeling for the API Blueprint tools that are available
2. Provide a CI based workflow for validating software components based on an
   Apib spec.
   Speciffically:
    * Debug HTTP requests
    * Validate Server implementations
    * Validate Client implementations


This is a polyglot workshop, so there should be something for everybody. We
will try and keep the produced code to basic language syntax to allow everybody
to follow allong, regardles language profficiency.
