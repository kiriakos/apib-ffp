# API Blueprint For Fun and Profit (APIB-FFP)

What we want to achieve in this workshop:

1. Get a feeling for the API Blueprint tools that are available
2. Provide an automated workflow for validating software components based on an
   Apib spec.
   Speciffically:
    * We will create a Javascript service and test it with dredd
    * We will write a Java client and test it against drakov


This is a polyglot workshop, so there should be something for everybody. We
will try and keep the produced code to basic language syntax to allow everybody
to follow allong, regardles language profficiency.
